repo-style-guide

This is a template repository to capture some design and style guide consistency across repositories.  It is getting messy and I want to get more consistent.

## TODOs:
- Objective: Inventory all repositories; kill stale ones especially stale experiments
- Objective: Make all titles, descriptions and headings consistent
- Objective: Check "above the fold" consistency
- Objective: Check all .gitignore
- Objective: Check all open source licenses files (i.e., should be MIT license)
- Objective: Consolidate MOOC repositories and descriptions to make more easy to navigate
